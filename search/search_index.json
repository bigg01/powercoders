For this we use a Pod which is the smallest deployable unit of computing that you can create and manage in OpenShift. A Pod is a group of one or more containers. In this exercise, we will deploy a Pod that runs a single container with the image rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest . Note For each exercise you can choose and only have to do either the 'Web Console' or the 'Command Line Interface (CLI)' section in oder to complete the exercise.
