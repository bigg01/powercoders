In this exercise, we will deploy a Pod that runs a single container with the image rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest .

Try some of the formats: wide , json , yaml oc get pods -o <output format> oc describe can be used to get detailed description of a given resource. Inspect the information and events of your pod Pod . oc descirbe pod <pod name> Print the logs for a container in a pod using the oc log command in order to check if the application in the Pod was started successfully. oc logs <pod name> Also check the 'Inspect a Pod' section for the Web Console.
