The Deployment involve a ReplicaSet to manage the Pods in the background. The ReplicaSet ensures that specified number of Pod replicas are running all the time. If a Pod crashes or is deleted the ReplicaSet create new instances up to the defined number. Likewise, if there are more Pods running than desired, it deletes as many as necessary. Check out the OpenShift or Kubernetes Documentation for more information about Deployemnts and ReplicaSets .

The ReplicaSet itself adds another random string to the each Pod (e.g. p9w5h ). What happens if you delete a pod uisng oc delete pod <pod name> ?

However, Pods are non-permanent resources and are created and destroyed by the Deployment dynamically. Therefore the IP addresses of your application are changing dynamically too and it is difficult to keeps track of which IP address to connect to.

Instead of connecting to the IP addresses of the Pods directly you can connect instead to its Service . Check out the Kubernetes Documentation for more information about Services . Routes \u00b6 The Route allows to expose services through HTTP(S) via a public DNS entry. This is needed to make Services accessible from outside of the cluster.

There are 2 endpoints connected to your Service , you can figure that out by using the oc describe command. [~] $ oc describe service <service name> ... Endpoints: <IP endpoint 1>:8080,<IP endpoint 2>:8080 ... The reason that there are 2 endpoints is that we have 2 replicas configured in the Deployment . Let's compare the IP addresses of the endpoints with the IP address of each Pod . The IP address of the Pods can be retrieved using the oc get pods -o wide command. As you can see the Service is successfully connected to all Pods of your Deployment .
