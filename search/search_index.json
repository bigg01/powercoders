The Pod created from the Deployment have a random name. Example: httpd-12cf4d11ce-p9w5h The Deployment adds a random string (e.g. 12cf4d11ce ) to the deployment name while creating the ReplicaSet . The ReplicaSet itself adds another random string to the each Pod (e.g. p9w5h ). What happens if you delete a pod uisng oc delete pod <pod name> ? The ReplicaSet of the Deployment automatically creates a new Pod . The same would happen if the application in the container of the Pod crashed or terminated.

For this we use a Pod which is the smallest deployable unit of computing that you can create and manage in OpenShift. A Pod is a group of one or more containers. In this exercise, we will deploy a Pod that runs a single container with the image rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:latest .

Try some of the formats: wide , json , yaml oc get pods -o <output format> oc describe can be used to get detailed description of a given resource. Inspect the information and events of your pod Pod . oc descirbe pod <pod name> Print the logs for a container in a pod using the oc log command in order to check if the application in the Pod was started successfully. oc logs <pod name> Also check the 'Inspect a Pod' section for the Web Console.
